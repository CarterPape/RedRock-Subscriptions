A plugin wrapper for selling subscriptions and restricting access to content with WordPress and Memberful.

## Description

A wrapper around the WordPress membership plugin, [Memberful WP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/memberful-wp/), which integrates your site with [Memberful](https://memberful.com). Memberful is a service for selling subscriptions to your website with [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

This wrapper adds and changes functionality implemented by the Memberful team in their core plugin. These modifications are to customize and improve the experience of subscribing to The Times-Independent, a newspaper in Moab, Utah.
